# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This is the third bootcamp challenge. This assignment is focused on creating an portfolio using bootstrap. 

## Description

This was the third bootcamp challenge. It's purpose was to create a portfolio website using bootstrap. The code from bootstrap was customized to fit the theme of the webpage. The instructions were as follows:

Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

-A navigation bar. A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use Bootstrap's navbar or create your own. Include links that are applicable to your portfolio. Links should navigate to the appropriate sections

-A hero section. A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

-A work section. A section displaying your work in grid. Use Bootstrap cards for each project. The description should give a brief overview of the work. Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

-A skills section. List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp. An about/contact section

-An About Me section in the same row.
A footer section. All hyperlinks should have a hover effect. All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.


Using bootstrap is an incredibly valuable tool that allows me to create simple designs instead of writing the code from scratch. This is extremely useful as it will be a timesaver in future projects and tasks.
